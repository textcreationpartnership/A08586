            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This duty is ≈øo per≈øpicuous that it needs no large di≈øcour≈øe to procure credence: for not onely diver≈øe undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confirmations which might be drawne from Gods ≈øacred truth, and many unan≈øwerable rea≈øons declare its nece≈ø≈øity: but even experience (the mi≈øtre≈ø≈øe of more wi≈øedome then folly) teacheth us that <hi>≈øtones</hi> in a building ≈øupport each other: That <hi>branches</hi> of a tree doe ≈øo draw nouri≈øhment from the ≈øtocke, that each hath ≈øufficient ≈øappe, and proportionable to its nece≈ø≈øity. That <hi>members</hi> of our bodies are not onely carefull of them≈øelves, but of their fellowes. In≈øomuch that the eye is bu≈øie to adorne the body, yet not it ≈øelfe: the hands to cover the whole, them≈øelves remaining naked. That <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17758:15"/> friends</hi> are in pro≈øperitie a plea≈øure, a ≈øolace in adver≈øitie, and in griefe a comfort, yea ≈øuch who account a mans mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap their mi≈øery, the pricking of our finger the piercing of their heart. And this Doctrine I have now in hand doth tell us that all comforts of this goodfellow≈øhip are <hi>≈øtones</hi> of the ≈øame building, then which there cannot be a more firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. <hi>Branches</hi> of the ≈øame vine: then which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a more inherent inoculation. <hi>Members</hi> of the ≈øame body, in the which there is a mo≈øt ≈øweet concordance. Are all in an inviolable league of <hi>friend≈øhip,</hi> in which fellow≈øhip there ought to be no fal≈øhood: where ≈øimpathy of manners ≈øhould make conjunction of minds, and therfore tho≈øe of this con≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation cannot but relieve the di≈øtre≈ø≈øes each of other. In≈øtead therefore of proving the point which is undeniable, let me per≈øwade you to practi≈øe the duty ≈øo tragicall to many men.

In pro≈øecuting this filiall duty, I intend to have the judgement rightly informed how God mu≈øt be honoured, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade by certaine motives the affections to practice this fourth ≈øiliall duty.</p>
               <p>God may be honoured or de≈øpi≈øed many wayes, but the≈øe three e≈øpecially.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In him≈øelfe or his owne per≈øon, diver≈øe wayes. 1.

               <p n="2">2. In his ≈øervants: either Prophets or people, Mini≈øters or members of Chri≈øt: when they are honoured for his ≈øake, or his gifts and graces are honoured in them. <hi>God</hi> is honoured in his Mini≈øters, when tho≈øe branches of honour are given to them which the Word of God requires.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17758:45"/> their Doctrine. 3. Imitation of their good example. 4. Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his ≈øacred and holy Ordinances: Word, Sacraments, prayer, or other parts of his Service, when they are reverently &amp; rightly u≈øed. So men may di≈øhonor God by the ≈øame means or after the ≈øame manner, <hi>≈øc.</hi> when any of the afore≈øaid duties are denied or wanting, he is di≈øhonoured in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe or ≈øervants: and in regard of his Ordinances, when any of them are refu≈øed or abu≈øed.</p>
               <p>Wee are to honour our Heavenly Father with ≈øoule and body both, for <hi>he created them both,</hi> Eccl. 12. 1. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Creatour,</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>Spirit to God who gave it.

               <p>Let drunken bea≈øts and pot-companions; Let infatuated prodigals, and riotous ≈øpend-thrifts; Let ≈øwa≈øhing ≈øwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerers, who ≈øport them≈øelves at the godly ≈øimplicity of hone≈øt men, and all other of the ≈øame kind a≈ø≈øume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, and give to their companions their owne proper titles: <hi>≈øc.</hi> fooles, bea≈øts, ≈øonnes of Belial, &amp;c. And not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon this title which is properly due to none but ≈øuch who have <hi>fellow≈øhip with the Saints, the Father, and his Sonne Ie≈øus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I hope that you under≈øtand ≈øufficiently by the foregoing di≈øcour≈øes the admirable and un≈øpeakable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of all <hi>goodfellowes,</hi> or true believers: being combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the mo≈øt a≈øtrictive ties in fellow≈øhip with the Lord of glory, his ble≈ø≈øed Sonne, and gracious Saints, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. As al≈øo the wretched and mi≈øerable condition of all other a≈ø≈øociations, who have indeed a fellow≈øhip, but mo≈øt abominable and ba≈øe, with the fruitle≈ø≈øe works of darkne≈ø≈øe, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 5. 11. As al≈øo mo≈øt dangerous, and dreadfull, <hi>Prov. 13. 20. Acompanion of fooles ≈øhalbe de≈øtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I hope al≈øo that you of the wi≈øer ≈øort of tho≈øe who as yet are without having any well-wi≈øhes unto your ≈øelves, are per≈øwaded to flee amaine, ≈øeeking an ha≈øty e≈øcape from all tho≈øe unfruitfull fellow≈øhips with the deeds, and doers of darkne≈ø≈øe; as <hi>Lot</hi> from <hi>Sodome</hi> ≈øo full of villany, ≈øo neare de≈øtruction; and to ha≈øten ≈øpeedily, as the creatures into <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, to be firmely knit, and in≈øeparably incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into this ≈øociety, abounding with ≈øuch felicities, and contentments.</p>
               <p>4. And I doubt not but that you which have already admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into, and acquaintance in this <hi>goodfellow≈øhippe,</hi> by the former particulars are animated, and encouraged to cleave more clo≈øely unto, and to proceed more comfortably and couragiou≈øly in the ≈øame; it abounding with ≈øuch variety of excelling priviledges, and tran≈øcendent prerogatives,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17758:149"/> maugre Sathans ≈øubtill and helli≈øh temptations, and the worlds de≈øpightfull u≈øage, and injurious calumniations.</p>
               <p>Of which hopes if I doe not faile, I have that I labour for. I having declared the≈øe things unto you, 1. <hi>That you al≈øo</hi> (which as yet are ≈øtrangers from this heavenly communion) <hi>may have fellow≈øhippe with us,</hi> which you need not either dread or ≈øhame; for <hi>truly our fellow≈øhippe is with the Father, and his Sonne Ie≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> 2. And that you which are infranchi≈øed into this Society, may walke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfortably and couragiou≈øly through the many cro≈ø≈øing oppo≈øitions you meet withall in he holy path. Or to end with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles words, <hi>that your joy may be full.</hi>
