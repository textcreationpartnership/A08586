         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body doe whatſoever they doe to the common good, or profit: So likewiſe ſhould Chriſtians referre all their actions to the utilitie of the whole body. 1. The Church.</p>
               <p>We ſhould therfore relieve one another, as members of the ſame body. This duty is ſo perſpicuous that it needs no large diſcourſe to procure credence: for not onely diverſe undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confirmations which might be drawne from Gods ſacred truth, and many unanſwerable reaſons declare its neceſſity: but even experience (the miſtreſſe of more wiſedome then folly) teacheth us that <hi>ſtones</hi> in a building ſupport each other: That <hi>branches</hi> of a tree doe ſo draw nouriſhment from the ſtocke, that each hath ſufficient ſappe, and proportionable to its neceſſity. That <hi>members</hi> of our bodies are not onely carefull of themſelves, but of their fellowes. Inſomuch that the eye is buſie to adorne the body, yet not it ſelfe: the hands to cover the whole, themſelves remaining naked. That <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17758:15"/> friends</hi> are in proſperitie a pleaſure, a ſolace in adverſitie, and in griefe a comfort, yea ſuch who account a mans miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap their miſery, the pricking of our finger the piercing of their heart. And this Doctrine I have now in hand doth tell us that all comforts of this goodfellowſhip are <hi>ſtones</hi> of the ſame building, then which there cannot be a more firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. <hi>Branches</hi> of the ſame vine: then which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a more inherent inoculation. <hi>Members</hi> of the ſame body, in the which there is a moſt ſweet concordance.

Inſtead therefore of proving the point which is undeniable, let me perſwade you to practiſe the duty ſo tragicall to many men.

               <p>FOurthly, we are to honour our Heavenly Father, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6.<note place="margin">Duty 4.</note> 
                  <hi>A ſonne honoureth his Father. If I be a Father where is mine honour? Our Father—hallowed be thy Name,</hi> is the continuall cry of Gods children, and it's a neceſſary inference. If we ought to honor our fathers by nature, precedency of time, age, and office, much more the Lord our Heavenly Father. In proſecuting this filiall duty, I intend to have the judgement rightly informed how God muſt be honoured, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade by certaine motives the affections to practice this fourth ſiliall duty.</p>
               <p>God may be honoured or deſpiſed many wayes, but theſe three eſpecially.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In himſelfe or his owne perſon, diverſe wayes. 1. By <hi>obeying</hi> him and ſubmitting our ſelves to him. 2. <hi>Beleeving</hi> in him and truſting to him. 3. <hi>By calling</hi> upon him, and praying to him. 4. In <hi>loving</hi> him above all. 5. In <hi>fearing</hi> him above all. 6. In <hi>confeſſing</hi> of his truth. 7. In <hi>confeſſing</hi> of our ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his ſervants: either Prophets or people, Miniſters or members of Chriſt: when they are honoured for his ſake, or his gifts and graces are honoured in them. <hi>God</hi> is honoured in his Miniſters, when thoſe branches of honour are given to them which the Word of God requires. As: 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in thought, word, and geſture. 2. Obedience to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17758:45"/> their Doctrine. 3. Imitation of their good example. 4. Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his ſacred and holy Ordinances: Word, Sacraments, prayer, or other parts of his Service, when they are reverently &amp; rightly uſed. So men may diſhonor God by the ſame means or after the ſame manner, <hi>ſc.</hi> when any of the aforeſaid duties are denied or wanting, he is diſhonoured in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or ſervants: and in regard of his Ordinances, when any of them are refuſed or abuſed.</p>
               <p>Wee are to honour our Heavenly Father with ſoule and body both, for <hi>he created them both,</hi> Eccl. 12. 1. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Creatour,</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>Spirit to God who gave it. Hee redeemed them both,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. <hi>He ſanctifieth them both,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 23. <hi>He preſerves them both, Pſal.</hi> 97. 10. And he will <hi>glorifie both, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 49. But firſt with the ſoule, <hi>Pſal. 103. 1, 2. Bleſſe the Lord O my ſoule.</hi> And that: 1. Becauſe the Lord requires it moſt, <hi>Deut. 6. 4. Ioh.</hi> 4. 24. 2.

Yet let every adopted child of the Lords be exhorted to honour our heavenly Father:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inwardly: and that firſt in his underſtanding. 1. By an effectuall, ſpirituall, diſtinct, ſpeciall, lively, experimentall, and conſequently, ſaving knowledge of God, the want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cauſing a denyall of honour to the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 1.

Secondly, in his affections. 1. By a ſpirituall child like or ſiliall feare, whoſe fruit and force is to reſtraine from vice, and conſtraine to well-doing for deſire to glorifie God. 2. By a Chriſtian love a fruit and ſigne of a juſtified perion, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us to delight in God for his goodneſſe ſake, and in our neighbour for Gods ſake.</p>

It's poſſible (I know) for theſe <hi>goodfellowes</hi> to fall in part, and for a time from ſome graces, ſome meaſure of grace, and from former ſignes, and ſenſe of Gods favour. Of graces <hi>ſome</hi> are principall, and abſolutely neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vation, as faith, hope, love, theſe may be leſſened, decayed, and covered in regard of operation, <hi>Pſal. 51. 10. Create in me a new heart. Some</hi> are leſſe principall, yet requiſite, and very profitable, as the feeling of Gods favour, chearefulneſſe in prayer, joy in the Holy Ghoſt; which leſſer graces may be quite loſt for a time. <hi>Me thinkes</hi> ſuch like conſiderations as theſe following may ſufficiently incourage all of this ſociety againſt feare of not continuing in the love and favour of God. 1. <hi>Such</hi> are the gifts of <hi>God the Father</hi> to his onely <hi>Sonne Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> Which Donatives he will not loſe, <hi>Iohn. 6. 39. Neither ſhall any take them out of his hands, 10. 28. 2. Such</hi> are the precious purchaſe of the invaluable bloud of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lambe, the Sonne of God, more worth then milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of worlds, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. Things dearely bought are deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved, dearely beloved are carefully kept, and not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly loſt. 3. <hi>Such</hi> have <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> praying for them, <hi>Luke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Heb. 7. 25. <hi>That they may be with Chriſt. 4. Such</hi> are kept by the invincible power of God, through faith unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5. 5.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17758:68"/> day of redemption, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. Therefore it is as poſſible, 1. <hi>For Ieſus Christ,</hi> that invincible Lion of the Tribe of Iuda, victoriouſly conquering ſinne, Sathan, death and damnation. 2. <hi>For the Lord of Hosts,</hi> whoſe hoſts and armies are all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from the moſt contemptible flyes and lice, to the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt Angels: whoſe omnipotencie is ſuch, that he effecteth what he will, all things being alike poſſible to him: It's as poſſible (I ſay) for the Sonne and Father to be overcome, as for the Saints, being kept and preſerved by them both. 3. <hi>It's as poſſible</hi> for Gods decree to ſuffer mutation and change, and ſo for that Lambes Booke of Life (for ſo is the Decree of Gods Election called) continually to be mutilate, ſubject al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to defacing by having the names of ſome of Gods Elect blotted out of the ſame; and yet <hi>there is no variableneſſe with the Lord, nor the least ſhadow of changing, Iam. 1. 17. 4. For the</hi> ingraven ſeale of Gods ſanctifying Spirit to be blotted out, and ſo to be more uncertaine then thoſe of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians. 5. For</hi> the ineſtimable bloud of the immaculate Lambe <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> to be as water ſpilt upon the earth. 6. <hi>For</hi> the pureſt and moſt prevailing prayers that ever aſcended to the Lord of Sabbaths, the meritorious petitions of Gods owne Sonne to be of no force (and yet the Prayers of one righteous man availeth, if it be fervent, <hi>Iames 5. 17.) 7. For Gods</hi> promiſe to be unfaithfull, as for thoſe who have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Father, to fall from grace finally, totally: But the one, therefore the other are altogether impoſſible. I know the Prophet (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24.) ſaith, <hi>when the righteous,</hi>

Enliven thy ſelfe after this or the like manner. I confeſſe mine owne imbecillitie, the fall of my firſt parents in Paradiſe in their innocency, and their poſteritie; neither am I ignorant of the number, nature, and properties of mine enemies. What then? Muſt I therefore of neceſſitie fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? No ſuch matter. 1. <hi>I am</hi> weake and ſeeble. True. <hi>But</hi> I doe not reſt upon my ſelfe, but upon the Lord, who keeps me, who is greater then all, neither is any able to pluck me out of my Fathers hands, <hi>Iohn 10. 29. 2.

Neither</hi> did <hi>Adam</hi> ſtand in innocency, nor <hi>Sathan</hi> in glory. True; they ſtood by their owne ſtrength; ſo do not I: by Chriſt I ſtand, and am kept by the power of God to ſalvation. 4. <hi>The ſtrongest</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity have fallen: yet not finally; <hi>Peter</hi> was winnowed, <hi>Paul</hi> buffeted: <hi>But</hi> they roſe againe, their faith did not faile, Gods grace was ſufficient for them. Winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I may be, buffeted I may be, overcome can I not be: for my life is hid with Chriſt in God. 5. <hi>Mine enemies</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: yet more with me, then againſt mee, 2 <hi>Reg. 6. 6.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17758:87"/> commandeth, but rest in ungodlineſſe, and filthineſſe, pranſing in their pride, pranking, and pricking, pointing and painting, themſelves to be gorgeous, and gay: they reſt in exceſſe, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity, in gluttony, and drunkenneſſe, like rats, and ſwine: they reſt in brawling, and railing, in quarrelling, and fighting: they rest in wantonneſſe and toyiſh talking, &amp;c.

               <p>This I ſuppoſe is a commodious and profitable, neceſſary and warrantable, Chriſtian (not Iewiſh) reſolution, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from thoſe worldly and wanton words, workes, and thoughts: and to be wholly imployed, and that delightfully in thoſe holy and heavenly contemplations, communications and actions. And that I may ſtirre you up to put in practice this ſo laudable, ſweet, and profitable reſolution: to thoſe former reaſons and motives I have intermingled in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17758:96"/> paſſages, give me leave to adde theſe following reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and pious arguings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is the Lords Day the queene of dayes, yea, the Lords market day for our ſoules, wherein we are to <hi>buy,</hi> Iſa 55. 2. <hi>without money or mony worth,</hi> the heavenly and celeſtiall <hi>bread, water, wine,</hi> and <hi>milk</hi> of Gods ſacred Word, and ſaving graces, the golden gifts and precious merits of Chriſt to inrich our faith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. The <hi>eye-ſalve</hi> of true wiſdome, and the Spirit of light to illuminate our ſpirituall blindneſſe, and the <hi>white raiment</hi> of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, that we may be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and that the ſhame of our nakedneſſe do not appeare; and ſhall we paſſe it away in wanton delights, in fruitleſſe, and hurtfull diſcourſes, in diſtruſtfull, and diſtracting muſings, or in needleſſe and dunghill actions? And not rather ſpend this Day in buying ſuch peereleſſe traffique, not onely in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique aſſemblies, but alſo before and after the ſame, by Divine contemplations, heavenly communications, fervent, and faithfull prayer, and other ſuch like pious Lords Dayes practices?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is this the Lords Day, not mine, his Holy Day, no common or prophane one; therefore to be ſanctified, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be kept holy; and ſhall we ſhew ſuch intolerable ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as to deny ſo ſmall uſe of time to him, that gives to us ſo much and ſo large uſe of time?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it a matter of duty, and not of curteſie; of charge, and not of choice; of allegiance, and not of liberty; of neceſſity, and not of indifferency: not permitted, but commanded to ſanctifie the Lords Day, and keepe it as holy as we can; and ſhall not wee uſe our utmoſt endeavour to doe the ſame?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do thoſe who conſcionably ſanctifie the Lords Day, imitate the prime and pureſt examples, walking in thoſe paths which have beene traced out by <hi>David, Nehemiah,</hi> and ſuch like ones; by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſuch a Sonne, ſuch a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; by the <hi>Lord Iehovah,</hi> who reſted the ſeventh Day from his worke of creation, although as eaſie to him as to ſpeake, and cauſe it to be created: And ſhall we be drawne into
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17758:97"/> unwarranted courſes, or omit neceſſary pious duties upon Gods Day; becauſe many who are great Schollers, good Preachers, great men, the wealthieſt in our pariſh, and many honeſt men make no bones of worldly diſcourſings, unneedful actions, nor are very forward in thoſe other ſubſtantiall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Learning they may have, wiſdome, greatneſſe, yea, goodneſſe, yet may their example be erroneous, no ſufficient patterne for imitation: in many things we offend all; yea, and good S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> would be followed no otherwiſe then he followed Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 1. Be it</hi> they be wiſe or wealthy, honourable or honeſt, who give or take liberty; yet ſure we are, we take the ſureſt and ſafeſt courſe, yea, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and comfortable, having Gods precept for our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and his example for our encouragement. Powerfull they may be, but he is omnipotent; wiſe they may be, but he is wiſdome it ſelfe; honeſt they may be, he goodneſſe it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Since the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is a bleſſed Day; ſo called, either, 1. Becauſe it is inſtituted to Gods ſervice. 2. Or becauſe the Lord gave it a ſingular priviledge to be a Day of reſt and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a Day of delight and heavenly feaſting, to the world. 3. Or becauſe the Lord doth bleſſe more effectually all ſuch who conſcionably keepe it holy, on that Day then any other: ſo that then they enjoy after an extraordinary manner this tranſcendently ſweet, and lovely <hi>fellowſhip with the Father.</hi> We for our parts will alienate and eſtrange our ſoules, tongues and bodies, ſo farre forth as in us lieth, from ſuch workes, ſuch words and thoughts which withdraw the mind from God: and endeavour to ſpend thoſe little parcels of time, which remaine to us exempt from the publique aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Saints, and the doing of ſome few neceſſary actions, in Divine contemplations, Chriſtian communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch pious and holy actions, that ſo <hi>the Lord may ſuppe with us, and we with him, Rev.</hi> 3. 20. We feaſting him with the fruit of our true repentance. 2. With our faith, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and applying the Word and promiſes of God. 3. By ſerving God faithfully, giving up our ſoules and bodies, holy
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17758:97"/> and acceptable ſacrifices to him: he feaſting us in his Word and Sacraments. That ſo he may dwell in us, and we in him; and to conclude, that we may obtaine (if ſtill we want) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, or get (if already we have) a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and full aſſurance of our <hi>fellowſhip with the Father.</hi>

Another man dies, his gaines die with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 17. His treaſure was laid up on earth, therefore leaving this world he parts with his treaſure: the ſervant of God dies, his gaines follow him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. His treaſure was laid up in heaven, departing hence therefore he followes his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, goes to his gaine: Perhaps he forgoes a materiall buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and layes downe an earthly tabernacle; but he finds a building given of God, not made with hands, eternall in the heavens, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.

I will now forbeare to ſpeake of theſe three titles, his <hi>Sonne, Ieſus, Chriſt:</hi> It only ſufficeth for the preſent to tell you that Chriſt is Gods Sonne. 1. By Nature. According to his Divine nature he and he onely is the Sonne of God, being begotten of the ſame ſubſtance of the Father by an everlaſting generation, <hi>Math.</hi> 17. 5. 2. By Grace of perſonall union, the manhood of Chriſt being unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably united to the perſon of the Sonne of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35.

               <p>The firſt Propoſition is cleare: I prove the ſecond or minor thus.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are bride, and bridegroome; husband and wife, are linkt and conglutinated in the firmeſt connexion of the Matrimoniall knot, and Conjugall yoke.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> is the Bridegroome or Husband; all true belieuers, Saints, &amp;c. are the bride. Therefore Chriſt and Chriſtians are linkt and conglutinated, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt is the Husband to true believers, I thus prove.</p>
               <p>He who doth wooe, contract himſelfe unto, conſummate the match made with, and performe all duties of a husband to all true believers, Saints, or faithfull Chriſtians is their husband.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> doth all theſe to all true believers. As for example.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He wooeth, beſeeching us by his Miniſters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He contracts himſelfe unto the Church by a firme and free promiſe of mariage with his Church with the conſent of his Father.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He will conſummate the mariage at the end of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He promiſeth all duties of a husband to all true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; For inſtance.</p>
               <p>Husbands ought entirely to love their wives, <hi>Col. 3. 19. Eph.</hi> 5. 22. Love them they ought; for they are good things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 22. For they are their companions, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 14. And their owne fleſh, <hi>Eph. 5. 28. Chriſt Ieſus</hi> loved his Church with ſuch entire and ardent love, that he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17758:111"/> for his Church. But becauſe I will not ſtay upon conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall duties; in briefe I ſay; that no husband ever; nay if the excellency of all the moſt melting affectionateneſſe, and other chiefe vertues could be drawne out of all mankind that have beene, are, or ſhalbe, and infuſed into ſome Angelicall body; yet could not this imagined excellent husband love with ſuch a ſincere, and perpetuall love, cleave ſo cloſely and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactedly unto; give ſuch honor, or due benevolence unto, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate</hi> with ſuch raviſhing comforts, <hi>graunt</hi> more willingly the honeſt and reaſonable requeſts, <hi>governe,</hi> guide, and direct more prudently a wife lovely beyond imagination, as <hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> doth the Church, or true believers, Saints, or faithfull Chriſtians his Spouſe.</p>
               <p>That all true believers are the Spouſe of Chriſt is perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly tranſparent, <hi>Rev. 19. 7, 8. 21. 9. 22. 27. Iohn</hi> 3. 29. And in this that they owe the ſelfeſame duties to Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus which wives do owe to their husbands. <hi>ſc.</hi> Subjection, reverence, obedience, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore all true believers have fellowſhip with Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> All thoſe which are ingrafted and inoculated into <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> have fellowſhippe with Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God.</p>

               <p>The latter Propoſition I prove out of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>1. There is a husbandman, who is the Father, juſtly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the husbandman: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He hath a rightfull intereſt unto, and an abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne authority over his ſpirituall vine, vineyard, and branches; his is the right, not by Law, but by nature; not from any ſuperiour, but from himſelfe, and he may do with it what he will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of affection, the affection that he beares to this vine, vineyard, and branches is tranſcendent; he loves them tenderly, and delights in them wonderfully.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:17758:111"/>3. In regard of his actions: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He</hi> doth plant, <hi>i. e.</hi> joyne the elect taken out of the rotten ſtocke of old <hi>Adam</hi> unto Chriſt and his Church by the ſpirit. <hi>Pſal. 92. 13. Rom.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He</hi> doth water with the true doctrine of his Word, the holy ſpirit, and ſaving graces, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36. 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He</hi> doth expect as earneſtly fruit from his vineyard, as the husbandman doth from his, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He</hi> doth prune and purge out blindneſſe by the word of Knowledge, errour by the Word of Confutation, deſperation, by the word of Conſolation, &amp;c. and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, &amp;c. and on the contrary he rejects the fruitleſſe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that ſo they may wither, and be burned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 2. 4. 6.</p>
               <p>2. There is alſo a Vine, and there are branches abiding in that vine, <hi>Iohn 15. 4. Chriſt is a vine</hi> giving life of grace to all his members, as a vine gives juyce and life to all its branches; he miniſtreth to Chriſtians the ſappe of his grace, and ſpirit, whereby they live, grow, and bring forth good workes; even as a vine doth miniſter to the branches moyſture, ſappe, and juyce, whereby they live, flouriſh, and beare fruit. In this vine the <hi>roote</hi> is Chriſt, his God-head the <hi>ſtemme,</hi> his Manhood, the <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ppe,</hi> his graces, the <hi>branches,</hi> true beleevers, and the <hi>grapes</hi> good workes. Neither is this contradicted, where the Church is called a vine, Pſal. 80. 9. 14. Iſa. 5. 1. 2. 3. A vine it is whoſe ſenſe is Gods protection, whoſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are its watchmen, their doctrines and exhortations as a winepreſſe to wring out good duties as ſweet iuyce; and whoſe grapes are good workes as pleaſant fruite. Nor where Chriſt is called a branch as he oftentimes is, <hi>Ier. 33. 15. Zach.</hi> 3. 8. 6. 12. for when Chriſt is a branch, his Church is the vine, himſelfe the Head or chiefe branch, his Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour twigs, his graces ſappe, bloſſome, bud, and grapes. When the Church is a vine, Chriſt wholy is the roote, and ſtock; true beleevers the branches, whoſe obedience is the fruits, or pleaſant grapes; which way ſoever they are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Chriſt. Therefore <hi>have fellowſhip with Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>1. As he was obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. Submitting his will to his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 39. Even ſo we like that valiant Champion S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſhould be ready, not only to be bound, but to die for the name of the Lord Ieſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 23.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:17758:138"/>
               <p>As he did, ſo we ought to undergoe the Croſſe with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and patience. <hi>Iſa. 53. 7.

               </p>
               <p>3. As he did, ſo ſhould we offer up prayers, and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with ſtrong crying, and tears unto him that is able to ſave from death, <hi>Heb. 5. 7. O my Father, if it be poſſible,—not as I will, but as thou wilt.

               </p>
               <p>4. As he did depend upon God, <hi>Pſal. 22. 8. He trusted in God that he would deliver him.</hi> So ſhould we depend on God for deliverance. <hi>Pſal. 34. 19. Out of all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Thus to take up the Croſſe, and follow Chriſt Ieſus, is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of abſolute neceſſity, if we conſider,</p>

For to ſuffer the ſpoyling of theſe not long laſting tranſitorie traſhy riches, to have in heaven a better and an induring ſubſtance is no loſſe, but extraordinary advantage.

To endure Martyrdome, or to ſuffer death for the Faith of Chriſt, be it after the moſt ignominious, and opprobrious manner, and with the moſt helliſh, and horrible tortures Sathans agents and himſelfe can invent and inflict, is pronounced a bleſſing by the Spirit of Truth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13.</p>

Is faith ſo preciouſly excellent?</p>
               <p>1. Why O you ſonnes of men, do you ſo much ſleight it, and neglect it?</p>
               <p n="1">1. As not to labour at all for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or leſſe then for temporary fading favours; you'le ride, and run farre and neare; toyle and travaile early and late, for health and ſanity of your bodies; for increaſe and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of your ſubſtance, for food to eate, and clothes to put on: but ſo careleſly, and negligently for this, that were your endeavours no more earneſt for bodily health, death ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall would ſoone ſmite you: for food, and rayment; your tender backs and pampered bellies would quickly beſhrow you: for worldly wealth, beggery ſo baſe would out of hand overtake you.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:17758:143"/>3. Or more regardleſly then for any thing of baſe eſteem in regard of it: you take not cattell for your uſe at a venture, but after much ſearching and prying whether they be ſound and ſufficient: you receive not gold careleſly, but after tryall, whether it is currant coine and of ſufficient weight: You take not ſilver hand over head, but you firſt ſee whether it is paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble money; you turne and toſſe, rub, and ring each ſuſpected piece, leaſt you take braſſe for lawfull ſilver. And deale you thus with your faith? Do you examine whether you are in the faith? Do you try by the touch-ſtone of the Word, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is of the right kind, not that of Divels; not that of temporizers; not that of wicked ones, but that of the Elect, making them endeavour good, and ſhun ſinne? I would you did.</p>
               <p>2. Is faith thus excellent? Then you who wiſh well to your ſelves, priſe, and uſe all ſanctified meanes whereby it's gotten, kept, and increaſed. This is a pearle of price, the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all whereof is better then gold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7.

               <p>Of ſuch abſolute neceſſity is the having of Chriſts Spirit<note place="margin">Mot. 1.</note> abiding in us: That without it no ſaving faith, no ſound hope, no true love, no happy peace, no ſolid joy, no new birth, no new life, no ſpirituall adoption, no reall ingrafting into Chriſt, no union or communion with him, theſe all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graces, works and fruits of Gods Spirit.

               <p n="5">5. That the flouriſhing Formaliſt, performing thoſe many excellent, and praiſe-worthy duties he doth onely outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for by-ends, without the pith, marrow, and ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, uprightneſſe of heart.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the man wholly and altogether wanting the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his owne conſcience, grounded upon the teſtimony of Gods Spirit, that he is the child of God: and he who in ſtead of the teſtification of Gods Spirit, which ever agreeth to the Word, glads and contents himſelfe with the wicked ſpirit of preſumption, for his living willingly, conſtantly, and contentedly in thoſe wicked wayes the Word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes to helliſh torments; argues an abſence of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Gods Spirit: for is it poſſible that Gods Spirit ſhould peremptorily affirme in the Word, that no drunkard, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous perſon, hypocrite, &amp;c. ſhall inherite the kingdome of heaven; and yet teſtifie to the conſcience of a drunkard, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous perſon, hypocrite, &amp;c. that he is Gods child, and ſhall go to heaven?</p>
               <p>That none of theſe have the Spirit of Chriſt abiding in them; and therfore no <hi>fellowſhip with Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> may ſafely, &amp; muſt neceſſarily be inferred from the forenamed propoſitions.</p>

               <p>Secondly, and you of the laſt ſort, who have not the Spirit of Chriſt abiding in you; and therefore have no intereſt in this incorporation: forget not your miſerable condition; and let me entice and allure you to remedie the ſame by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get this Spirit, which is moſt of all and firſt of all to be ſought, <hi>Luc. 11. 13.

               <p>Do you therefore renounce and abdicate thoſe loathſome deeds of darkneſſe wherein you have hitherto walked. Do not reſt contented in your hollow, liveleſſe, and ſpiritleſſe performances of good actions and endeavour that by ſincere and hearty prayer, hearing, repentance, and obedience you may have the Spirit of God abiding in you, that ſo you alſo may <hi>have fellowſhip with Gods Sonne Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which will give you, 1.

               <p>TO theſe I might have joyned many other neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: certaine tokens of ſuch which enjoy; and availea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes for ſuch to uſe, who deſire to enjoy this happy community, and diſcourſed largely of them: But purpoſing now to end; I will onely nominate ſome, without any large dilating upon them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is the Shepheard, theſe are the ſheepe.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Chriſt is the Foundation, theſe are the ſtones.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſuch who partake of this Divine Society, as they owe of duty, ſo they teſtifie their incorporation into this connexion, and they which deſire ingredience into this peereleſſe communion muſt ſeeke the ſame, by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to paralell theſe reſemblances ſo farre forth as ſacred Writ doth enjoyne and warrant. <hi>e. g.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They are <hi>ſheepe;</hi> therefore as ſheepe are harmleſſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in regard of fleece, fell, carkaſſe, and dung very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and increaſeable, notwithſtanding many are killed, and many die: So theſe are innocent, ſuffering wrongs, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compencing to none evill for evill: very commodious to all about them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 10.

               <p n="2">2. They are <hi>braunches</hi> of Chriſt the Vine, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3. Therefore, as, 1. They grow exceedingly more then other trees. 2. Have plenty of ſappe within, when they ſeeme wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

               <p n="3">3. Theſe are the <hi>ſpouſe</hi> of Chriſt; therefore they ought to love, reverence, and feare him, heare his voice, and receive his inſtructions, obey his commandements, and be clad with his mariage garments, <hi>ſc.</hi> the gifts and graces of his Spirit.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The Concluſion, ſhewing the drift of all.</head>
               <p>BY that which I have ſpoken at ſundry times from this place concerning this ſubject of true <hi>goodfellowſhip,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſacred Writ who and what <hi>goodfellowes</hi> are; wiping away many foule and filthy aſperſions wherewith the world doth falſely blemiſh them; and declaring their duties and dignity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I hope you ſee the errour and injuſtice of this erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous world, depriving Gods Saints of this their rightfull denomination; and conferring it upon the moſt ſtigmaticall ſonnes of Belial. Is he a <hi>goodfellow</hi> truly, and onely who hath fellowſhip with the Saints, the Lord of heaven and earth, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt; And are they which ſtrive to imitate the Saints, endeavour to pleaſe God, and labour to have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Chriſt Ieſus, baſe companions, inſociable perſons, and unworthy the name of <hi>goodfellowes,</hi> becauſe they preferre this excellent communion before the beaſtly and Diabolicall ſociety with the fruitleſſe workes, and unhappy workers if darkneſſe? And ſhall ſuch which make open profeſſion of the Devills ſervice, are at open defiance with all manner of goodneſſe, be ſtiled and eſteemed <hi>goodfellowes,</hi> becauſe with ſhameleſſe foreheads, and flinty hearts they wallow in all manner of wickedneſſe, becauſe they ſweare and ſwagger, roare, and revell, ſcorne and ſcoffe at good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and good men, conſume waſtfully their patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and poſſeſſions in pipes and pots, in Tavernes and Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, in drunkenneſſe, and other damnable courſes? Yet this is the uſuall and common dealing of the moſt, although impious and ungodly; for what right have Sathans imps and agents to this holy title of <hi>goodfellow?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heare our Church ſpeake, which ſaith: <hi>If we lacke Ieſus Chriſt: that is to ſay, the Saviour of our ſoules and bodies, we ſhall not finde him in the market place, or in the Guilde Hall,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17758:148"/> much leſſe in the Ale-houſe or Taverne amongst goodfellowes, as they call them,</hi> &amp;c. Hom. of right uſe of the Church, Fol. 6.</p>
               <p>Let drunken beaſts and pot-companions; Let infatuated prodigals, and riotous ſpend-thrifts; Let ſwaſhing ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerers, who ſport themſelves at the godly ſimplicity of honeſt men, and all other of the ſame kind aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and give to their companions their owne proper titles: <hi>ſc.</hi> fooles, beaſts, ſonnes of Belial, &amp;c. And not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon this title which is properly due to none but ſuch who have <hi>fellowſhip with the Saints, the Father, and his Sonne Ieſus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I hope that you underſtand ſufficiently by the foregoing diſcourſes the admirable and unſpeakable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of all <hi>goodfellowes,</hi> or true believers: being combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the moſt aſtrictive ties in fellowſhip with the Lord of glory, his bleſſed Sonne, and gracious Saints, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. As alſo the wretched and miſerable condition of all other aſſociations, who have indeed a fellowſhip, but moſt abominable and baſe, with the fruitleſſe works of darkneſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11. As alſo moſt dangerous, and dreadfull, <hi>Prov. 13. 20. Acompanion of fooles ſhalbe deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I hope alſo that you of the wiſer ſort of thoſe who as yet are without having any well-wiſhes unto your ſelves, are perſwaded to flee amaine, ſeeking an haſty eſcape from all thoſe unfruitfull fellowſhips with the deeds, and doers of darkneſſe; as <hi>Lot</hi> from <hi>Sodome</hi> ſo full of villany, ſo neare deſtruction; and to haſten ſpeedily, as the creatures into <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, to be firmely knit, and inſeparably incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into this ſociety, abounding with ſuch felicities, and contentments.</p>
               <p>4. And I doubt not but that you which have already admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into, and acquaintance in this <hi>goodfellowſhippe,</hi> by the former particulars are animated, and encouraged to cleave more cloſely unto, and to proceed more comfortably and couragiouſly in the ſame; it abounding with ſuch variety of excelling priviledges, and tranſcendent prerogatives,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17758:149"/> maugre Sathans ſubtill and helliſh temptations, and the worlds deſpightfull uſage, and injurious calumniations.</p>
               <p>Of which hopes if I doe not faile, I have that I labour for. I having declared theſe things unto you, 1. <hi>That you alſo</hi> (which as yet are ſtrangers from this heavenly communion) <hi>may have fellowſhippe with us,</hi> which you need not either dread or ſhame; for <hi>truly our fellowſhippe is with the Father, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 2. And that you which are infranchiſed into this Society, may walke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfortably and couragiouſly through the many croſſing oppoſitions you meet withall in he holy path. Or to end with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words, <hi>that your joy may be full.</hi>
